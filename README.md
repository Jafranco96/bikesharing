# Bikesharing

## Overview of Project
### Purpose

Potential investors are interested in providing the backing capital to establish a CitiBike service in Des Moines, Iowa - similar to the existing service in New York City. The investors need to feel confident that such a CitiBike service can be successfully duplicated in Des Moines. 

Using public CitiBike data of the New York City service, an analysis was performed to identify the key aspects of the CitiBike service and a high-level visualization summary of the results was created in Tableau to present to the investors.

## Analysis Results 

The visualizations created are presented below - 

Visualization #1:

This visualization shows that a large majority of the Citibikes are checked out for less than an hour.

Visualization #2:

The majority of the rides utilizing the Citibikes are male riders.

Visualization #3:

The busiest utilization of the service by all riders occurs between 5:00pm to 6:00pm on Thursdays followed by 5:00pm to 6:00pm on Mondays and Tuesday.

Visualization #4:

Similarly to Visualization #2, this visualization shows that utilization during peak hours is being driven by male riders.

Visualization #5:

Most riders utilizing the Citibike services are paid service subscribers, particularly male subscribers, rather than one-off riders. Thursday is again the most utilized day.

Visualization #6:

<img src = "https://github.com/Jafranco96/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Viz%20%237.PNG">

In total, over 75% of all Citibike riders are paid subscribers.

Visualization #7:

Even with focusing on a particular month, August in this case, service utilization again peaks in the 5:00pm to 6:00pm time frame.

All visualizations can be accessed for further drilling down below:

## Analysis Results Summary

Summarizing all the visualizations, the main narrative identified is that the bulk of Citibike services are utilized by male riders in the late-afternoons hours. It can be hypothesized that these are male workers using the Citibikes to commute back to their residential places. Des Moines, being both a metropolitan area and the capital of Iowa, will have a substantial amount of people in this potential-riders demographic.  

While the analysis should allow the investors to feel confident in backing the Citibike service in Des Moines, there are additional visualizations that could be useful for future analysis. Since it is known that male riders are the most frequent service users, it would be valuable to further identify what is the most frequent age range of these male users. This would help in recognizing what is the base demographic for Citibike services to the most granular level. Another beneficial visualization would be a monthly trend line of service utilization. This would identify in what peak months the Des Moines services should be commenced.
